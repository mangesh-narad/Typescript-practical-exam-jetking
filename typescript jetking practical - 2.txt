2) Write a TypeScript program that calculates the area of a
triangle.
=function calculateTriangleArea(base: number, height: number): number {
    return (base * height) / 2;
}

let base: number = 10;
let height: number = 5;
let area: number = calculateTriangleArea(base, height);

console.log(`The area of a triangle with base ${base} and height ${height} is ${area.toFixed(2)}`);
